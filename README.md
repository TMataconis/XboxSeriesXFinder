# XboxSeriesXFinder
 Used to find any new Xbox Series X in stock in Various Stores

 Able to search these stores:
 - BestBuy
 - Walmart
 - Target
 - Microsoft
 - Lenovo
 - NewEgg
 - GameStop
 - Amazon

Once a store is found to have stock, an email will be sent to the email given in the code


This is not refined code, I just wrote this while I was trying to buy the Series X and thought that this could alert me when one came in stock.

It works on my personal computer, but I am not sure whether it will compile on other machines
